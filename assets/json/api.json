First among these changes was continued work on moving our code to React. We also expanded our reach by dialing in some effective channels to new communities, and onboarding new users with a basic product \u201ctour\u201d of our IDE. We also plugged in projects into our \u201cexperience\u201d, integrating Slither, and Hardhat, as well as updating the Remix VSCode extension. And, if that\u2019s not enough, we jammed on some tools for collaborative coding, improving Decentralized GIT and integrating Github. And last but not least, we\u2019ve updated our existing plugins. In short, we\u2019ve maxed it out to 11. Here are the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u00a0\u2026</p>\n<h3>Behind the\u00a0Curtain</h3>\n<h4>React!</h4>\n<p>One of this year\u2019s largest projects has been to move Remix entirely off our old framework and onto React. This move has made our code much more sustainable. Refactoring all this code has not been a small job, but it has been well worth the\u00a0effort!</p>\n<h4>Dependency Review</h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve updated our major dev dependencies to the latest stable\u00a0version.</p>\n<h3>Dialing in New Users and New Remix URL Parameters</h3>\n<h4>Outreach Workshops for\u00a0Impact</h4>\n<p>Remix team continued to give industry-specific Ethereum workshops. We call these workshops \u201cEthereum4\u201d\u2014as in Ethereum4 Musicians, Ethereum4 NGOs, Ethereum4 Healthcare, among\u00a0others.</p>\n<p>In a virtual setting, we gather together people from a variety of disciplines within specific fields at a number of organizations to explain how Ethereum\u2019s technology can be used in their industry, and then we introduce them to some Ethereum-based projects relevant for their field. In these meetings we also let them try some DApps, walk them through some smart contract code, and discuss potential projects they might want to undertake.</p>\n<p>Remix is an excellent tool for explaining the basic concepts of Ethereum because it\u2019s a point-and-click app that does not require any set up. Click to compile. Click to deploy. Click to interact with a function on a deployed contract. Get a transaction receipt. View opcodes. You can get users pretty far, pretty\u00a0quick.</p>\n<p>Over the past six months we have given Ethereum4 workshops to lawyers, doctors, and music professionals, and have also collaborated on a workshop with Benson Njuguna\u200a\u2014\u200aa Fellow from the Next Billion team\u200a\u2014\u200aabout Ethereum4 Startups in\u00a0Kenya.</p>\n<p>To learn more about these workshops, read our\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/ethereum4-by-remix-vertical-web3-education-146f238c0314\">article</a>.</p>\n<h4>Remix AMAs</h4>\n<p>In the fall, we began monthly \u201cAsk Remix Anything\u201d calls.</p>\n<h4>Onboarding Tour for New\u00a0Users</h4>\n<p>The first time you come to Remix, you\u2019ll now see a 3-step\u00a0tour.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/429/0*aDOLYOy2raYPEPjq\"></figure><p>In the coming year, we\u2019ll be expanding these tours to show users some of the underused gems within Remix. And, to get a sense of what tools have been underused and which continue to be popular, last spring we implemented Matomo analytics. Here\u2019s our latest <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remixs-analytics-report-366596a99e36\">analytics</a> report.</p>\n<h4>Load Remix with a File or GIST in the\u00a0Editor</h4>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to send someone the URL of a file and have it load in Remix? Ever wanted to send someone a GIST to load in Remix? If so\u2014or even if not\u200a\u2014\u200atake this URL for a\u00a0spin:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol\">https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol</a></p>\n<p>The parameters in the URL above will instruct Remix to load this file: <a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol\">https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol</a> in the Editor. The file will appear in the code-sample workspace.</p>\n<h4>The Parameter for Loading a GIST is\u2026\u00a0Gist</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/#gist=26bf5df1a91adef830342e7ec95da0ea\">https://remix.ethereum.org/#gist=26bf5df1a91adef830342e7ec95da0ea</a></p>\n<p>To see more about Remix url parameters, check out our\u00a0<a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/locations.html\">docs</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Remix VSCode Extension</h3>\n<h4>Compiling, Debugging, Metamask and\u00a0Remixd</h4>\n<p>Did you know that Remix has a VSCode extension? With it you can use Remix in VSCode. Over the past six months we have vastly expanded the functionality of this extension. Not only can you compile and use plugins that operate on the compilation result, but you can <strong>deploy</strong> to a local chain, like <strong>Ganache or Hardhat</strong>. And by connecting the VSCode extension to Remix IDE Online with Remixd, you can use <strong>Metamask</strong> in the browser to approve transactions, thus giving you access to <strong>public networks</strong>.</p>\n<p>For more info, see our <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remix-in-vscode-compiling-debugging-metamask-remixd-42c4a61817e2\">article</a> on the Remix VSCode extension.</p>\n<h3>Working Collaboratively on\u00a0Remix?</h3>\n<h4>We\u2019ve Got your GIT Decentralized and Github(bly) Centralized</h4>\n<p>Remix now can track your files as a git repository! You can deal with GitHub repositories, clone, push &amp; pull. All the good stuff. You can also store your repositories in IPFS and collaborate. All very exciting! This is done by using a plugin called dGit. <strong>Read more about it\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/github-in-remix-ide-356de378f7da\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Previously, you could work with <strong>Remixd</strong> to connect the browser to a folder on your hard drive in order to have version control there. But now, saving your files on Remix IDE Online has more\u00a0options!</p>\n<h3>Hardhat Console Logs Can Now be Seen in the Remix Terminal!</h3>\n<h4>\u201cHardhat in Remix???\u201d you\u00a0ask\u2026.</h4>\n<p>Hardhat projects can now be brought into Remix via <strong>Remixd</strong> and compiled with the Hardhat compiler or the Remix compiler.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*0TDhRumEVnSSTeYL\"></figure><h4><strong>Hardhat Console Logs in\u00a0Remix</strong></h4>\n<p>The big advancement in the past 6 months is that <strong>Hardhat console logs can be seen in the Remix Terminal when making a transaction or when </strong>running <strong>Solidity unit tests</strong>! Check the Remix <a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardhat_console.html\">docs</a> about Hardhat console\u00a0logs!</p>\n<p>To try it out, you\u2019ll need to input an import statement and use console.log to print the value as shown in the image\u00a0below.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/922/0*xSN-nTdjcVJQ32WH\"></figure><p>And, you\u2019ll get the log-in to the Remix terminal.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DvrM8a8EOalBdX1W\"></figure><p>Here is a link to the <a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardhat.html\">docs</a> about Hardhat integration on\u00a0Remix.</p>\n<h3>A New Editor:\u00a0Monaco</h3>\n<p>We have now moved Remix\u2019s code Editor to Monaco! The Monaco Editor looks just like the one in VSCode because\u2026<strong> it is the same one used in VSCode</strong>. The Monaco Editor is a much more mature, full-featured editor.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*b_AwTCxD4uH7Nnok\"></figure><p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right side column of tiny text allows you to quickly get to a section of your\u00a0code.</li>\n<li>Multiple cursors allow for writing the same thing on multiple\u00a0lines.</li>\n<li>A spaciously delicious (or deliciously spacious) gutter allows for delicious spaciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>File Explorer\u00a0Updates</h3>\n<h4>Right Click and See the Shortcuts!</h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve updated the Remix API, enabling plugin-specific items to the File Explorers\u2019<strong> popup context\u00a0menu</strong>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*UMk5SaIQtqXOx7AF\"></figure><h4>Multi-select</h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve added an easier way of deleting multiple files. Now you can <strong>Multi-select </strong>with <strong>shift + click</strong> and then Right-click to get a context menu to Delete\u00a0All!</p>\n<h4>Plugin Devs can Add to the Context\u00a0Menu</h4>\n<p>For all you plugin devs, your plugins can now register their own context menu items (right\u00a0click).</p>\n<h3>Debugger Updates</h3>\n<p>Now in the Debugger\u2019s Opcode list, we\u2019ve changed the color of the next five commands.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/0*qZJjd7EEJ-golG7F\"></figure><p>So when a JUMP\u00a0occurs\u2026</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/0*i4QXy5bNymrhBwdt\"></figure><p>the next five opcode will have a color change but that change happens where the JUMP lands (in JUMP DESTINATION).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/0*oCP7A6lm12qLJef_\"></figure><h3>Solidity Unit Testing\u00a0Update</h3>\n<p>When writing Solidity Unit Tests, have you needed to debug a transaction to see what is going on? Now there is a button to open the debugger on every Unit Testing transaction.

Then in the File Explorer\u2019s Workspace pulldown, select <strong>localhost</strong>. This will connect you to <strong>Remixd</strong> (always use the latest version). For more about <strong>Remixd</strong>, please check our\u00a0<a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixd.html\">docs</a>.</p>\n<p>In the Static Analysis plugin, a checkbox will ask if you want to enable Slither Analysis.

With gas pricing policies brought in with<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559\"> EIP 1159</a>, we updated Remix to support the London gas flavor of Ethereum. The change in the Remix UI is that we have updated the modal that appears when you <strong>deploy to the\u00a0Mainnet</strong>:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*evlyoHW6-SW5B-DM\"></figure><p>In this modal, Remix now asks for the new inputs: <strong>Max Priority fee</strong> and the <strong>Max\u00a0fee</strong>.</p>\n<p>But remember the Max fee<strong> MUST</strong> be more than the base fee. If it is less, you\u2019ll get an\u00a0error.</p>\n<p>And, if you do not put anything in the Max fee modal, you\u2019ll get an error complaining that you need to input a\u00a0number.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have never seen this modal, it only appears when deploying to the\u00a0Mainnet.</p>\n<h3>Help for Developing PLUGINS that INTERACT with other\u00a0PLUGINS</h3>\n<p>For you plugin devs!

First among these changes was continued work on moving our code to React. We also expanded our reach by dialing in some effective channels to new communities, and onboarding new users with a basic product \u201ctour\u201d of our IDE. We also plugged in projects into our \u201cexperience\u201d, integrating Slither, and Hardhat, as well as updating the Remix VSCode extension. And, if that\u2019s not enough, we jammed on some tools for collaborative coding, improving Decentralized GIT and integrating Github. And last but not least, we\u2019ve updated our existing plugins. In short, we\u2019ve maxed it out to 11. Here are the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u00a0\u2026</p>\n<h3>Behind the\u00a0Curtain</h3>\n<h4>React!</h4>\n<p>One of this year\u2019s largest projects has been to move Remix entirely off our old framework and onto React. This move has made our code much more sustainable. Refactoring all this code has not been a small job, but it has been well worth the\u00a0effort!</p>\n<h4>Dependency Review</h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve updated our major dev dependencies to the latest stable\u00a0version.</p>\n<h3>Dialing in New Users and New Remix URL Parameters</h3>\n<h4>Outreach Workshops for\u00a0Impact</h4>\n<p>Remix team continued to give industry-specific Ethereum workshops. We call these workshops \u201cEthereum4\u201d\u2014as in Ethereum4 Musicians, Ethereum4 NGOs, Ethereum4 Healthcare, among\u00a0others.</p>\n<p>In a virtual setting, we gather together people from a variety of disciplines within specific fields at a number of organizations to explain how Ethereum\u2019s technology can be used in their industry, and then we introduce them to some Ethereum-based projects relevant for their field. In these meetings we also let them try some DApps, walk them through some smart contract code, and discuss potential projects they might want to undertake.</p>\n<p>Remix is an excellent tool for explaining the basic concepts of Ethereum because it\u2019s a point-and-click app that does not require any set up. Click to compile. Click to deploy. Click to interact with a function on a deployed contract. Get a transaction receipt. View opcodes. You can get users pretty far, pretty\u00a0quick.</p>\n<p>Over the past six months we have given Ethereum4 workshops to lawyers, doctors, and music professionals, and have also collaborated on a workshop with Benson Njuguna\u200a\u2014\u200aa Fellow from the Next Billion team\u200a\u2014\u200aabout Ethereum4 Startups in\u00a0Kenya.</p>\n<p>To learn more about these workshops, read our\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/ethereum4-by-remix-vertical-web3-education-146f238c0314\">article</a>.</p>\n<h4>Remix AMAs</h4>\n<p>In the fall, we began monthly \u201cAsk Remix Anything\u201d calls.</p>\n<h4>Onboarding Tour for New\u00a0Users</h4>\n<p>The first time you come to Remix, you\u2019ll now see a 3-step\u00a0tour.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/429/0*aDOLYOy2raYPEPjq\"></figure><p>In the coming year, we\u2019ll be expanding these tours to show users some of the underused gems within Remix. And, to get a sense of what tools have been underused and which continue to be popular, last spring we implemented Matomo analytics. Here\u2019s our latest <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remixs-analytics-report-366596a99e36\">analytics</a> report.</p>\n<h4>Load Remix with a File or GIST in the\u00a0Editor</h4>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to send someone the URL of a file and have it load in Remix? Ever wanted to send someone a GIST to load in Remix? If so\u2014or even if not\u200a\u2014\u200atake this URL for a\u00a0spin:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol\">https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol</a></p>\n<p>The parameters in the URL above will instruct Remix to load this file: <a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol\">https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/apps/remix-ide/contracts/app/solidity/mode.sol</a> in the Editor. The file will appear in the code-sample workspace.</p>\n<h4>The Parameter for Loading a GIST is\u2026\u00a0Gist</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/#gist=26bf5df1a91adef830342e7ec95da0ea\">https://remix.ethereum.org/#gist=26bf5df1a91adef830342e7ec95da0ea</a></p>\n<p>To see more about Remix url parameters, check out our\u00a0<a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/locations.html\">docs</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Remix VSCode Extension</h3>\n<h4>Compiling, Debugging, Metamask and\u00a0Remixd</h4>\n<p>Did you know that Remix has a VSCode extension? With it you can use Remix in VSCode. Over the past six months we have vastly expanded the functionality of this extension. Not only can you compile and use plugins that operate on the compilation result, but you can <strong>deploy</strong> to a local chain, like <strong>Ganache or Hardhat</strong>. And by connecting the VSCode extension to Remix IDE Online with Remixd, you can use <strong>Metamask</strong> in the browser to approve transactions, thus giving you access to <strong>public networks</strong>.</p>\n<p>For more info, see our <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remix-in-vscode-compiling-debugging-metamask-remixd-42c4a61817e2\">article</a> on the Remix VSCode extension.</p>\n<h3>Working Collaboratively on\u00a0Remix?</h3>\n<h4>We\u2019ve Got your GIT Decentralized and Github(bly) Centralized</h4>\n<p>Remix now can track your files as a git repository! You can deal with GitHub repositories, clone, push &amp; pull. All the good stuff. You can also store your repositories in IPFS and collaborate. All very exciting! This is done by using a plugin called dGit. <strong>Read more about it\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/github-in-remix-ide-356de378f7da\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Previously, you could work with <strong>Remixd</strong> to connect the browser to a folder on your hard drive in order to have version control there. But now, saving your files on Remix IDE Online has more\u00a0options!</p>\n<h3>Hardhat Console Logs Can Now be Seen in the Remix Terminal!</h3>\n<h4>\u201cHardhat in Remix???\u201d you\u00a0ask\u2026.</h4>\n<p>Hardhat projects can now be brought into Remix via <strong>Remixd</strong> and compiled with the Hardhat compiler or the Remix compiler.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*0TDhRumEVnSSTeYL\"></figure><h4><strong>Hardhat Console Logs in\u00a0Remix</strong></h4>\n<p>The big advancement in the past 6 months is that <strong>Hardhat console logs can be seen in the Remix Terminal when making a transaction or when </strong>running <strong>Solidity unit tests</strong>! Check the Remix <a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardhat_console.html\">docs</a> about Hardhat console\u00a0logs!</p>\n<p>To try it out, you\u2019ll need to input an import statement and use console.log to print the value as shown in the image\u00a0below.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/922/0*xSN-nTdjcVJQ32WH\"></figure><p>And, you\u2019ll get the log-in to the Remix terminal.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DvrM8a8EOalBdX1W\"></figure><p>Here is a link to the <a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardhat.html\">docs</a> about Hardhat integration on\u00a0Remix.</p>\n<h3>A New Editor:\u00a0Monaco</h3>\n<p>We have now moved Remix\u2019s code Editor to Monaco! The Monaco Editor looks just like the one in VSCode because\u2026<strong> it is the same one used in VSCode</strong>. The Monaco Editor is a much more mature, full-featured editor.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*b_AwTCxD4uH7Nnok\"></figure><p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right side column of tiny text allows you to quickly get to a section of your\u00a0code.</li>\n<li>Multiple cursors allow for writing the same thing on multiple\u00a0lines.</li>\n<li>A spaciously delicious (or deliciously spacious) gutter allows for delicious spaciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>File Explorer\u00a0Updates</h3>\n<h4>Right Click and See the Shortcuts!</h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve updated the Remix API, enabling plugin-specific items to the File Explorers\u2019<strong> popup context\u00a0menu</strong>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*UMk5SaIQtqXOx7AF\"></figure><h4>Multi-select</h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve added an easier way of deleting multiple files. Now you can <strong>Multi-select </strong>with <strong>shift + click</strong> and then Right-click to get a context menu to Delete\u00a0All!</p>\n<h4>Plugin Devs can Add to the Context\u00a0Menu</h4>\n<p>For all you plugin devs, your plugins can now register their own context menu items (right\u00a0click).</p>\n<h3>Debugger Updates</h3>\n<p>Now in the Debugger\u2019s Opcode list, we\u2019ve changed the color of the next five commands.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/0*qZJjd7EEJ-golG7F\"></figure><p>So when a JUMP\u00a0occurs\u2026</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/0*i4QXy5bNymrhBwdt\"></figure><p>the next five opcode will have a color change but that change happens where the JUMP lands (in JUMP DESTINATION).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/0*oCP7A6lm12qLJef_\"></figure><h3>Solidity Unit Testing\u00a0Update</h3>\n<p>When writing Solidity Unit Tests, have you needed to debug a transaction to see what is going on? Now there is a button to open the debugger on every Unit Testing transaction. It\u2019s the button with a BUG on\u00a0it.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*HA2xfIPzGzUnstdF\"></figure><h3>Static Analysis with\u00a0Slither</h3>\n<p>Slither is a popular static analysis tool that usually runs from a\u00a0CLI.</p>\n<p>To get Slither working with Remix, you need to have Slither installed as well as solc and solc-select. Then in the File Explorer\u2019s Workspace pulldown, select <strong>localhost</strong>. This will connect you to <strong>Remixd</strong> (always use the latest version). For more about <strong>Remixd</strong>, please check our\u00a0<a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixd.html\">docs</a>.</p>\n<p>In the Static Analysis plugin, a checkbox will ask if you want to enable Slither Analysis.

Not only is it a helpful tool to find out how people are using Remix, but we can also use it to uncover problems in our UI and to track down bugs. By the way, we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) on our instance of Matomo. For more about how we use Matomo,<a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/help-us-improve-remix-ide-66ef69e14931\"> please see this post</a>.

But, if it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t want to use Remix in a browser, you can instead use <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases\">Remix Desktop</a>, our electron app\u2014or our <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RemixProject.ethereum-remix\">Ethereum Remix VSCode </a>extension or read our <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remix-in-vscode-compiling-debugging-metamask-remixd-42c4a61817e2?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ddb5aa5c76db9c385ca3f036a1117b4d\">article</a> about\u00a0it.</p>\n<h3>Workspaces</h3>\n<p>In the next major step of moving Remix to React, we have rewritten Workspaces.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*oKfqnPqHYodfh-ggPbvojg.png\"></figure><p>In the next release, the Vertical Icons panel will be in\u00a0React.</p>\n<h3>Matomo Updates</h3>\n<p>Starting in March of 2021, we implemented Matomo, an open source analytics platform. Not only is it a helpful tool to find out how people are using Remix, but we can also use it to uncover problems in our UI and to track down bugs. By the way, we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) on our instance of Matomo. For more about how we use Matomo,<a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/help-us-improve-remix-ide-66ef69e14931\"> please see this post</a>. And, for our first report on what we\u2019ve been finding within the statistics we track, <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remixs-analytics-report-366596a99e36?source=friends_link&amp;sk=6570d43b44ce812a02ad4993ae9d57df\">please see this\u00a0post</a>.</p>\n<p>To cite one example here: people are using L2s more and more so we have just started to track the number of deployments to specific custom networks. Discovering which networks are being used will help us improve Remix. And, speaking of L2s, a Starkware plugin will be arriving\u00a0soon.</p>\n<h3>Thank You Esteemed\u00a0Users</h3>\n<p>Please report any problems you find in Remix. Also please send us your suggestions about any changes you\u2019d like to see in Remix, or any functionality you think would be useful to\u00a0add.</p>\n<p>We strive to make the IDE more convenient and easy to use.

It is a plugin that connects to a script. You can load it in the Plugin manager or by selecting <strong>connect to localhost</strong> in the Workspaces select\u00a0box.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/350/1*Jd3y97SMj26VxTpRAdkeUw.png\"></figure><p>Remixd connects the Remix webapp to your file system. You need to have the Remixd script running in the background, and it will connect the specific instance of Remix to a specified folder on your hard drive. With Remixd, you can clone repos as big as your hard drive. When you clone a repo from github to a local folder, you will see it in Remix. And if the browser crashes, your files won\u2019t be lost, they\u2019ll be on your hard\u00a0drive.</p>\n<p>In October, Remixd was loaded <strong>45,623</strong>\u00a0times.</p>\n<h3>Other Plugin Activation Stats for October\u00a02021</h3>\n<p>Here is a list of some plugins and the number of times they have been activated in\u00a0October:</p>\n<p><strong>Flattener</strong>: <strong>18,899</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source Verification, </strong>AKA the Sourcify plugin, to<strong> verify contracts</strong> and to <strong>fetch the source code of verified contracts</strong>: <strong>12,923</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Etherscan, </strong>to verify contracts: <strong>10,608</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Learneth, </strong>Remix\u2019s tutorial tool (soon to get some great new tutorials): <strong>14,943</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solhint, </strong>a linter for Solidity: <strong>9,832</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Walletconnect, </strong>to<strong> </strong>approve transactions on a mobile wallet (as I stated above this is likely how your users will be interacting with your DApp):\u00a0<strong>6,242</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1clickDApp, </strong>which makes a simple front end for your DApp:\u00a0<strong>5,355</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Celo, </strong>to deploy to the Celo chain:\u00a0<strong>4,846</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gas profiler, </strong>to get the total gas usage of your contract as well as its line by line usage:\u00a0<strong>4,132</strong></p>\n<h3>Old Experience</h3>\n<p>Remix was launched in 2016. It had roughly the same interface until the Spring of 2018 when we updated the design. But, in case of user preference, we did leave a link on the home tab to launch the \u201cold experience\u201d (the old design). Surprisingly, this link was activated <strong>970</strong> times in October. Maybe because I\u2019m a fan of the \u201cnew\u201d or should I say \u201cnewer\u201d layout (because it is not so new anymore), this number seems pretty high. Although assuming that someone is coming to Remix every day (maybe this is a large assumption), if we divide that 970 by 31 (for the 31 days of October), we get 31. So there are at least 31 people who seem to prefer the \u201cold experience.\u201d</p>\n<h3>See for yourself and thanks for using\u00a0Remix!</h3>\n<p>You can check out our stats yourself at <a href=\"https://matomo.ethereum.org/\">https://matomo.ethereum.org</a>. <br>We\u2019ll give you another update about Remix usage and associated factoids in mid 2022.

And if the browser crashes, your files won\u2019t be lost, they\u2019ll be on your hard\u00a0drive.</p>\n<p>In October, Remixd was loaded <strong>45,623</strong>\u00a0times.</p>\n<h3>Other Plugin Activation Stats for October\u00a02021</h3>\n<p>Here is a list of some plugins and the number of times they have been activated in\u00a0October:</p>\n<p><strong>Flattener</strong>: <strong>18,899</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source Verification, </strong>AKA the Sourcify plugin, to<strong> verify contracts</strong> and to <strong>fetch the source code of verified contracts</strong>: <strong>12,923</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Etherscan, </strong>to verify contracts: <strong>10,608</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Learneth, </strong>Remix\u2019s tutorial tool (soon to get some great new tutorials): <strong>14,943</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solhint, </strong>a linter for Solidity: <strong>9,832</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Walletconnect, </strong>to<strong> </strong>approve transactions on a mobile wallet (as I stated above this is likely how your users will be interacting with your DApp):\u00a0<strong>6,242</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1clickDApp, </strong>which makes a simple front end for your DApp:\u00a0<strong>5,355</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Celo, </strong>to deploy to the Celo chain:\u00a0<strong>4,846</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gas profiler, </strong>to get the total gas usage of your contract as well as its line by line usage:\u00a0<strong>4,132</strong></p>\n<h3>Old Experience</h3>\n<p>Remix was launched in 2016. It had roughly the same interface until the Spring of 2018 when we updated the design. But, in case of user preference, we did leave a link on the home tab to launch the \u201cold experience\u201d (the old design). Surprisingly, this link was activated <strong>970</strong> times in October. Maybe because I\u2019m a fan of the \u201cnew\u201d or should I say \u201cnewer\u201d layout (because it is not so new anymore), this number seems pretty high. Although assuming that someone is coming to Remix every day (maybe this is a large assumption), if we divide that 970 by 31 (for the 31 days of October), we get 31. So there are at least 31 people who seem to prefer the \u201cold experience.\u201d</p>\n<h3>See for yourself and thanks for using\u00a0Remix!</h3>\n<p>You can check out our stats yourself at <a href=\"https://matomo.ethereum.org/\">https://matomo.ethereum.org</a>. <br>We\u2019ll give you another update about Remix usage and associated factoids in mid 2022.

These are practical workshops with titles such as Ethereum 4 Musicians, Ethereum 4 NGOs, Ethereum 4 Healthcare etc.</p>\n<p>In these workshops, we gather together a variety of disciplines of a field from different organizations, explain how Ethereum\u2019s technology can be used in their industry, introduce them to some Ethereum based projects relevant for their field, get them to try some DApps and walk them through some smart contract code, and discuss potential projects that they could undertake.</p>\n<p>Most Ethereum education focuses on developers\u200a\u2014\u200aand you\u2019d think this would be the approach Remix would take\u200a\u2014\u200aas it is a technical tool. Well in fact we do take that approach in much of our outreach\u200a\u2014\u200abut in the Ethereum 4 initiative we are taking a broader view. For a blockchain project to happen within an organization, many of its departments would be involved\u200a\u2014\u200aand these players need to have a handle on what the technology can do.

Also organizations have to keep up with their competitors. The Ethereum4 program meets these\u00a0needs.</p>\n<p>With Ethereum4, the Remix team is reaching beyond our usual community to have animated &amp; mutually informative conversations. With some mentoring, these conversations will lead to new projects using Ethereum with an impact in the \u2018traditional\u2019 world.</p>\n<h3><strong>Welcoming new communities to\u00a0Ethereum</strong></h3>\n<p>In the past 5 months, we have had workshops for nonprofits, and for music professionals. We are soon to be having workshops for Lawyers, Healthcare Admins and we\u2019re planning on having workshops for accountants, artists, and farmers among others. Our attendees have been from: Milan Digital Week, Amnesty International Italy, BRAC, Medicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Acre Africa, CIFA onlus, CBM Italia, Music Innovation Hub Milan, Music Tech Europe Academy, Music Tech Deutschland, SIAE, and Legal\u00a0Hackers.</p>\n<h3><strong>The History</strong></h3>\n<p>In planning for their April 2021 event, the Milan Digital Week asked for assistance from @matlemad. He wanted to focus the workshop on Ethereum for musicians and asked the Remix team to collaborate with him. As we built that workshop we realized we had a new model of outreach\u200a\u2014\u200awhich\u00a0is\u2026</p>\n<h3><strong>Part One</strong></h3>\n<p>A workshop of 4\u20136 hours split over a few days with about 15 participants. The small number of participants ensures we can have a participatory &amp; conversational workshop and not a \u201chow to\u201d lecture. We also choose our participants to make sure we have a diversity of skills and job titles. We develop our curriculum for each workshop with an <strong><em>ambassador</em></strong> from the field\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone who helps us choose demos that our participants will care about and who helps us translate blockchain babble to their industry\u2019s lingo and the other way\u00a0around.</p>\n<p>In the classes, we also compare the constraints of web2 applications used in the industry vertical (with its location addressed content, data tampering, non interoperability, opacity, censorship etc) with web3 applications and discuss the pros and cons of\u00a0each.</p>\n<p>We also have the attendees discuss an Ethereum project that they could develop (within their org or by hiring some devs) that would address a problem in their\u00a0field.</p>\n<h4><strong>Some points that have been raised in our intro workshops</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The need for voting secrecy in DAOs &amp; that need is not easily\u00a0solved.</li>\n<li>The need for programmable Anti Money Laundering (AML) features for DAOs and Multisig wallets (e.g. a whitelist of addresses a DAO can receive ETH/ERC20/NFTs from).</li>\n<li>The ownership of digital assets is hard to grasp \u2013and its details\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as the permanent storage of a digital asset can be\u00a0tricky.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cool thing in these workshops is that we lean on the workshop\u2019s ambassador to help communicate to the group and we use the depth of technical knowledge in the Remix\u00a0team.</p>\n<p>After attending one of these workshops, our attendees will often want to some follow-up with us and with each\u00a0other.</p>\n<h3><strong>Follow up</strong></h3>\n<p>The followup program is designed to help mentor our alumni, so that they can bring some Ethereum project to fruition. We have a regularly scheduled calls with our alumni with presentations of new topics to help them organize their own starter projects &amp; proof of concept projects. We also help find mentoring sessions with <em>buidlers</em> of the ETH ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Ethereum4 is a new project, so we have not yet had participants go on to make projects within ( or outside) their organizations, but we have targeted several of our alumni\u2019s projects as ones that have the potential to be sustainable.</p>\n<p>And beyond mentoring our participants blockchain development, we are also providing the connections so that our participating NGOs can potentially receive the proceeds from an NFT sale. If the legal and accounting department of one large NGO will agree to accept, others doubtlessly will join\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3><strong>The program is small &amp; hands on but it could\u00a0scale</strong></h3>\n<p>These workshops address specific industries. The interesting thing in the blockchain space is that disparate industries can use similar solutions\u200a\u2014\u200alike certificates of authenticity or registries of ownership are useful in many different applications. So by building up a library of educational material, we can pretty easily give a workshop to a very different field but using similar examples.</p>\n<p>Our demos currently include DAOs, multisigs, dividend contracts, registry contracts, escrow contracts, voting contracts (on-chain and tokenless), signaling on Rollup L2, crowdsale contracts and NFTs. Of course we don\u2019t use all of these examples in every workshop\u200a\u2014\u200ajust where appropriate.</p>\n<p>The first part of growing this program involves building out our library of demos to include many of the current use case paradigms.</p>\n<p>Then to expand the number of attendees &amp; the number of workshops given, we would need to have people in the community use and adapt our teaching material and give these industry specific workshops on their\u00a0own.</p>\n<h3>Ethereum4 Workshops can make an\u00a0impact</h3>\n<p>The current media narrative of the blockchain space begins with money laundering and moves on to the price of crypto currencies. We quickly bring our participants past the blockchain hype\u200a\u2014\u200abut we always have to deal with the hype. Ultimately, the goal of Ethereum 4 and all Ethereum education projects is to get people trained, get them to build some projects, and also to get those projects some visibility so the public, the media, and governments have a better understanding of our blockchain technology and what it can\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>This story was co-authored with <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c1a1fea33584\">Rob\u00a0Stupay</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>GET IN\u00a0TOUCH!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum4.eth.link/\">Ethereum4 by Remix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eth4byrmx\">JavaScript is not available.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=146f238c0314\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/ethereum4-by-remix-vertical-web3-education-146f238c0314\">Ethereum4 by Remix, vertical web3 education.</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide\">Remix Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*o5J9PBkxWVYtkFpkxX4SAA.jpeg\"></figure><p>The Remix team has begun a program to provide industry specific Ethereum workshops.

If the legal and accounting department of one large NGO will agree to accept, others doubtlessly will join\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3><strong>The program is small &amp; hands on but it could\u00a0scale</strong></h3>\n<p>These workshops address specific industries. The interesting thing in the blockchain space is that disparate industries can use similar solutions\u200a\u2014\u200alike certificates of authenticity or registries of ownership are useful in many different applications. So by building up a library of educational material, we can pretty easily give a workshop to a very different field but using similar examples.</p>\n<p>Our demos currently include DAOs, multisigs, dividend contracts, registry contracts, escrow contracts, voting contracts (on-chain and tokenless), signaling on Rollup L2, crowdsale contracts and NFTs. Of course we don\u2019t use all of these examples in every workshop\u200a\u2014\u200ajust where appropriate.</p>\n<p>The first part of growing this program involves building out our library of demos to include many of the current use case paradigms.</p>\n<p>Then to expand the number of attendees &amp; the number of workshops given, we would need to have people in the community use and adapt our teaching material and give these industry specific workshops on their\u00a0own.</p>\n<h3>Ethereum4 Workshops can make an\u00a0impact</h3>\n<p>The current media narrative of the blockchain space begins with money laundering and moves on to the price of crypto currencies. We quickly bring our participants past the blockchain hype\u200a\u2014\u200abut we always have to deal with the hype. Ultimately, the goal of Ethereum 4 and all Ethereum education projects is to get people trained, get them to build some projects, and also to get those projects some visibility so the public, the media, and governments have a better understanding of our blockchain technology and what it can\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>This story was co-authored with <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c1a1fea33584\">Rob\u00a0Stupay</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>GET IN\u00a0TOUCH!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum4.eth.link/\">Ethereum4 by Remix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eth4byrmx\">JavaScript is not available.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=146f238c0314\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/ethereum4-by-remix-vertical-web3-education-146f238c0314\">Ethereum4 by Remix, vertical web3 education.</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide\">Remix Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["ethereum-education","remix-ide","blockchain-education","ethereum"]},{"title":"Remix IDE v0.18.0 is Released","pubDate":"2021-09-17 20:02:01","link":"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remix-ide-v0-18-0-is-released-d6605c50817e?source=rss----56beb2e247c7---4","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d6605c50817e","author":"Rob Stupay","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l338YbNGRK6mJiNoIG5gYg.png","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l338YbNGRK6mJiNoIG5gYg.png\"></figure><p>As we enter the autumnal season\u200a\u2014\u200awith its exciting \u201cback to school energy\u201d, the Remix team serves up a release to fasten you into this period of\u00a0work.</p>\n<h4>New version of Remixd\u200a\u2014\u200aRemixd Users: please\u00a0update!!</h4>\n<h3>The Big\u00a0News</h3>\n<p>Major updates to our <strong>dGIT</strong> plugin to allow\u00a0for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Github Integration!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Even more git\u00a0tricks!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But before we get to the brand new stuff, we should give you a reminder of the recent, though not latest developments.</p>\n<p>Which include\u2026 <a href=\"https://medium.com/remix-ide/remix-in-vscode-compiling-debugging-metamask-remixd-42c4a61817e2\"><strong>A Remix extension for VSCode</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardhat.html\"><strong>Hardhat Integration</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slither.html\"><strong>Slither Integration</strong></a></p>\n<p>And now to the\u00a0release\u2026</p>\n<h3>GitHub integration</h3>\n<p>Remix now tracks your files as a git repository!

Then select the \u201copen in Remix option and you\u2019ll be sent to Remix with the code sample loaded in a workspace called code-sample. The file is sent encoded in the\u00a0URL.</p>\n<p>With this release, when the some code is sent via a URL parameter, the Solidity compiler is auto loaded. If you want auto-compile enabled this can be turned on via a URL parameter.</p>\n<h3>Thank You Esteemed\u00a0Users</h3>\n<p>Please report any problems you see in Remix.
